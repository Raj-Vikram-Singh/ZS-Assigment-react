# Description

# Frontend
There are two pages: a graph and a table in the UI.

# Graph Page
* The graph will be a time series graph. It shows the number of events that occurred in a selected time range. (See data.json file)
* The time range should be selected from a calendar with start time and end time.

# Table Page
* The data table will have more information about the same events that we show on the graph.
* Table should be paginated.
* The default visible columns on the table are timestamp, attacker.id, attacker.ip, attacker.name, type and decoy.name.
* Users should be able to select visible columns, for which there should be a separate selector where we can select all the columns that are visible on the table.
* Users can sort and filter on the table columns.
